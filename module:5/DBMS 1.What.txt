DBMS

1.What do you understand By Database.
-> It is a software program that controls the organization,storage, management and retrieval of data in in database. 
it allows the user to add and modify the data in the database so that form and report also can be created.

2.What is Normalization?
->Database normalization or database normalisation is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by British computer scientist Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model.

3.What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
->
DBMS
● applications store data as a file.
●Data is generally stored either in a hierarchical form or in a navigational form.
●Normalization is not present.
●Does not support distributed database.
-----------------------------
RDBMS
● applications store data in a tabular form.
●Tables have an identifier called primary key and the data values are stored in the form of tables.
●Normalization is present.
●Supports distributed database.

4.what is mf codd rule of rdbms systems?
Rule 1: Information rule
Rule 2: Guaranted Access
Rule 3: Systematic treatment of NULL
Rule 4: Active Online Catalog
Rule 5: Powerful and Well-Structured Language
Rule 6: View Updation Rule
Rule 7: Relational Level Operation
Rule 8: Physical Data Independence
Rule 9: Logical Data Independence
Rule 10: Integrity Independence
Rule 11: Distribution Independence
Rule 12: Nonsubversion Rule
----------------------------------------------------
5.what do you understand by data redundancy
->Data redundancy is a condition created within a database or data storage technology in which the same piece of data is held in two separate places.
------------------------------------------------------
6.what is ddl interpreter in dbms?
DDL Interpreter: It processes the DDL statements into a set of table containing meta data (data about data). 
Query Optimizer: It executes the instruction generated by DML Compiler
Embedded DML Pre-compiler: It processes DML statements embedded in an application program into procedural calls. 
-----------------------------------------------
7.what is dml compiler in sql?
->DML compiler translates DML statements in a query language into a low-level instruction and the generated instruction can be understood by Query Evaluation Engine
8.What is SQL Key Constraints writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints
->
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
